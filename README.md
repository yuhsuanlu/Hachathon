# 2023 Athena Hackathon

## About Our Idea: AnimalAmigo
Welcome to AnimalAmigo, a web app designed to guide you in reducing your water, electric, and carbon footprint. By taking simple tasks to reduce your energy usage, you can earn reward coins to keep your beloved animal healthy. However, if you fail to complete the tasks, the reward coins will be deducted. The usage data will be visually displayed through the use of Matlab. Our mission is to encourage people to reduce their monthly energy usage through a fun animal-keeping game and visualized graphs to save animals around the world and promote sustainability.
We have combined a news and community page on this web app to help you easily access news and tweet data about green topics. By sharing these on your social media platforms such as Facebook, you can raise public awareness about environmental issues. Additionally, we have implemented a log in function for users to keep their records and track their progress.
We invite you to join us on this innovative and exciting journey towards becoming Animal Amigos and giving our animals a better living environment. Please enjoy our little game and learn more about our product and team member formation on this web app. Together, let's work towards a more sustainable future!
